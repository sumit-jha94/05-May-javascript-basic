     <h2>Learning For javascript</h2>
     <br>

     
     <h3>
     <p><u>
        Syntax is rules to write any code
        </u>
    </h3>

     
     

     <p>
        let a = 7; - this is javascript code
        <p>
        This whole process of writing a code is called as  "Declaring Variables"
    </p>
       <i> 
    <p> a is called as - identifier</p>
       <p> = is called as assignment operator</p>
       <p> 7 is literal </p>
    </p>
</i>
</p>
     <br>

      <ol>
      <h3> Rules Of Chosing variables names:- </h3> 
      <ul> 1. letters, digit, underscore and $ sign</ul>
      <ul> 2. Must begin with a, $, _, letter </ul>
      <ul> 3. This is case sensitive </ul>

    <h3>
        const Vs let Vs var 
    </h3>

    <p>
        var - used before ES6 code. It could cause error in our code. Need to be avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
        var can be updated and re-declared.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        let - used to declare block scoped variables.
    </p>

    <p>
        let can be updated not re-declared.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        const - is used to declare constant. The values cannot be changed throughout our course.
    </p>

    <p>
        const can neither be redeclared nor updated.
    </p>

    <p>
        const cannot be changed. We have to take other varible name.
    </p>
